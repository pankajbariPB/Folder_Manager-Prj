Description:
Folder Manager is a simple yet powerful Python script that helps you organize your files effortlessly.
 It automatically scans a target directory and sorts all files into subfolders based on their file extensions 
 (e.g., .pdf files go into a pdf folder). This keeps your folders neat, tidy,
and easy to navigateâ€”perfect for managing downloads, documents, or any cluttered directory.
âœ¨ Features
1. Automatic File Organization: Sorts files into subfolders by extension.
2. No Setup Required: Just specify your folder path and run the script.
3. Handles All File Types: Supports files with or without extensions.
4. Safe & Efficient: Skips directories and creates folders only as needed.
5. Cross-Platform: Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

ðŸš€ How It Works
Specify the folder you want to organize.

Run the script.

All files are moved into subfolders named after their extensions (e.g., jpg, pdf, no_extension).
